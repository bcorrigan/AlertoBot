Alertobot
=========

One day I was fed up of not discovering that my train line was disrupted by snow or wind or act of God, until I had risen from bed and reached the train station and saw the big "CANCELLED" sign in the station.

How much better would it be to know immediately, so you can work from home or travel via alternate means?

It turns out that twitter is jam packed with bots that spew out traffic and rail snafus. But, they are far too spammy to directly follow yourself.

So I created alertobot. Alertobot will apply rulesets against specified twitter accounts it should follow. These rule sets can be associated with users who will be notified.

If you are only interested in Kilmarnock-Glasgow Central trainline incidents, alertobot tells you only of those, if you make a ruleset that filters @NREScotrail's tweets.

When alertobot finds a matching tweet, it will direct message you. If your phone is set up you should therefore receive a highly visible alert the moment there is a problem.

Alertobot is a simple daemon written in scala using the SBT build system. Edit rules.conf appropriately, and background alertobot on some server, forever.
